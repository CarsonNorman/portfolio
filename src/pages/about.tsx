      <p className="text-lg">
        My name is Carson Norman, I am a full-stack developer based out of Long
        Beach California. I have a variety of passions such as software development, problem solving, and games that are too complicated for their own good.
        I love learning new
        things and my goal is to make fun, interactive, and of course easy to
        maintain projects that can be both enjoyed and relied on.
        <br />
